# Library

The ABC Book Company wants to implement a system to manage their books more efficiently. The system 
should allow both employees and patrons to checkout, find, and list books. A data file containing a sample 
list of books is provided. The data file contains a combination of four different types of books: childrenâ€™s books,
 cookbooks, paperbacks, and periodicals. Each book is uniquely identified using an ISBN and the information for each 
 type of book is described in the formatting section.
